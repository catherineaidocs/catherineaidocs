# Security and Privacy

Security and privacy are at the heart of Catherine AI, ensuring your business data remains protected.

* Data Protection: Catherine AI operates offline, keeping all interactions local to prevent data leaks, making it ideal for sensitive industries like finance and healthcare. Offline access ensures uninterrupted operations and data security without an internet connection. It can process voice commands, manage tasks, and respond to inquiries locally, even in remote or disconnected environments, minimizing the risk of data breaches. This feature is particularly valuable for businesses in rural areas, during network outages, or for mobile professionals, providing a robust solution for continuous operation.
* Encryption: We use AES-256 encryption, a military-grade standard, to safeguard user information and ensure that all data processed by Catherine AI is secure from unauthorized access.
* Privacy Policy: Our comprehensive privacy policy, available at \[link], outlines how we handle data, ensuring transparency and compliance with global regulations. With these measures, Catherine AI provides a secure environment for businesses to operate confidently.
