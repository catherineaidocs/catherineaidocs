# Project History

Catherine AI originated as a concept to create a secure, offline voice assistant for businesses, addressing the growing need for automation and data privacy.

Key milestones include developing its offline mode in early 2024, achieving 98% noise-canceling accuracy by mid-2024, and integrating multilingual support (Russian, English, Chinese) by late 2024.&#x20;

The project continues to evolve, with plans to expand language support and introduce new features in 2025.
